Installation:
-------------

copy the file to somewhere 'global'
use .Net's InstallUtil to register the DLL:

C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\InstallUtil.exe adExt.dll

or the 64-bit version if your OS is 64-bit:

C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\InstallUtil.exe adExt.dll

(you need permission to write to the directory where adext.dll is and to the registry HKLM\Software\microsoft\MMC)


use the /u flag to uninstall.

if the install fails with a could not load assembly error try running mmcperf.exe that will register the MMC assemblies in the GAC.

This extension adds two tabs to the User Property Sheet. One allows you to view/edit the EmployeeID and EmployeeNumber
AD fields and the other to edit/view the jpegPhoto and thumbnailPhoto fields.

When loading the thumbnailPhoto Field, the image is resampled down to  96 x 96, and the jpeg quality is chosen to have the size < 10KB

when loading the jpegPhoto the image jpeg quality is reduced to have the size < 100KB.

the fields are not editable if you dont have write access for the field.
